To build and run this project, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory (.\nodejs\stock-exchange-manager).
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

npm install

3. Start the development server by running the following command:

npm start

4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the dashboard page with the navigation links.


Note: Make sure you have a running backend server that provides the necessary APIs for managing stocks, stock exchanges, and their relationships.

If you encounter any issues during the setup or running the project, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help.



Use a Process Manager : 

Use a process manager like PM2 to keep your application running:

Install PM2 globally:

npm install -g pm2

Start the application:

pm2 start server.js --name "stock-frontend"

Configure PM2 to auto-start on server reboot:

pm2 startup
pm2 save
pm2 restart --name "stock-frontend"

Use PM2 monitoring tools:
pm2 monit

Secure the Application
Use HTTPS: Set up an SSL certificate to run your application over HTTPS.
Set proper headers: Use helmet for setting secure HTTP headers.

npm install helmet

const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());


Reverse Proxy 
Set up a reverse proxy like Nginx to forward requests to your Node.js application:

Install Nginx:

sudo apt install nginx

Configure Nginx: Edit the Nginx configuration file (/etc/nginx/sites-available/default):


server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
Restart Nginx:

sudo systemctl restart nginx
